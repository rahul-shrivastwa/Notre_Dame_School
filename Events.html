                        <p>“There is no garden as beautiful as childhood”</p>
                        <p>Children’s Day this year was celebrated across the city virtually due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic restrictions. Besides the grave social, economic, and health impact on people around the globe, the COVID-19 pandemic’s silent blow on children of all ages is profound. But in spite of all these odds, Children’s Day was celebrated in Notre Dame School with a lot of vigour and enthusiasm, virtually.</p>
                        <p>It was definitely not the same as regular celebrations but the teachers went out of their way to use technology and do the best they could in the times of pandemic. We may not be in the physical space but are connected digitally. Teachers recorded their motivational speeches, sang songs, played games, recited poems etc., all this was live-streamed by the teachers on 14th November in their respective classes.</p>
                        <p>The Principal, Sr. Mary Alice beautifully explained the students how they need to take up personal responsibility and learn about personal growth and metamorphically stated that children are the light in this world. She also focused on the fact that real education enables us to handle any situation peacefully, finding the good, even in worse situations. She blessed the students and their families, quoting the famous adage,” There are things which you cannot buy which also includes childhood days!”. Students appreciated the creativity of the teachers amid the ‘New Normal’. The programme had a series of interesting and exciting events all planned meticulously for complete entertainment. It was an effort to give back a little, what the children had been deprived of, after the outbreak of this pandemic.</p>
                        <p>Last year, Greta Thunberg, a Swedish climate activist, took the world by storm after she gave her speech on the importance of active participation to fight climate change. Thunberg is proof of the fact that children are aware of the changes around them and wish to do their part in making the world a better place.</p>

                        <p>Goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes. Because, for those who love with their heart and soul, there is no such thing as separation! But for every beginning, there must be an end. It’s paradoxical but that’s how it is.</p>
                        <p>On January 18, 2020, the entire Notre Dame family gathered to bid farewell to an exceptional teacher, an altruistic human being, Sir Jose. The beauty of the stage was enhanced by an aesthetically pleasing backdrop and the lamp waiting to be lighted. The amazing programme began with a prayer song and a prayer dance. The students were beautifully dressed and they presented a number of dance performances. Students presented some skits, followed by speeches appreciating the nature of Sir Jose.</p>
                        <p>This sense of humour and his dressing sense would be adamantly admired by everyone. He would be remembered by many students as a guide and mentor who helped shape their lives for the better. He is extremely charismatic and knew how to interact with his students on a personal level. He knew the art of adding charm to even the most boring lesson.</p>
                        <p>His finesse and his passion for literature gave him an unmatched ability to add life to mere fictional characters. The programme ended with a song by the choir, melodiously sung.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, Sir Jose expressed his feelings, his experiences and his journey in Notre Dame School after which Sr. Alice appreciated Sir and blessed the gathering. The day was great, filled with nostalgia, fun and excitement. Saying good bye is never easy. But, that is a bitter truth of life.</p>
